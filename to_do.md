# EDA to do list

## Things we have done:
- Found data
- Understood how the data is structured
- Figured out how to get total passengers entering/exiting a station per week (i.e. per data set)
- Figured out that there are outliers
- Figured out how to remove them

## To do:
- Build the repo (get out code and data on GitHub)
- Assign different rolls to the project
- Exactly what stats do we want to present and in what format?
- How much data do we need?
- How to get the data?
- How to bring different data sets together?
- Apply our code to larger data sets
- What visuals do we want to use to aid our presentation?

## Once we have the basics down, it would be nice if we could:
- extend our analysis further... to what, we don't know
