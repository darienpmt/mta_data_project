# EDA to do list

## Presentation flow
1. 1-2 minute introduction.
 - Explain to the client what they should learn from the presentation. We will present data to show them the top 10 busiest stations
   by total foot traffic coming in and out. We'll also show the average traffic by weekday so, if you want, you can target particular 
   days of the week.
 - Additionally, despsite what our data says, it may also be a good idea to send people to collect emails from subway stations close
   to where the event will be held. People are more likely to attend if they do not have to venture very far!
 - We also recommend, if possible, that you send people to subway stations during peak hours, which according to the MTA, are from 
   6:30 am (yikes!) to 9:30 am, and 3:30 pm to 8:00 pm. **we may be able to provide some data to give them a more specifc range**
   
2. 1-2 minute body
- Very briefly explain the cleaning process. Maybe show an example of what the raw data looked like, then show them how we "cleaned"
  it up and why.
- Show them the top 10 stations by foot traffic coming in and out (**we need to make this point very clear**). 
- Show them the top 10 stations by weekday average. Make a note of the drop in traffic on weeks, especially at Grand Central.

3. 1-2 minute conclusion 
- This is when we should make our "official" recommendation. **Maybe narrow the recommendation down to five stations?**
- Make sure there is time for some questions at the end.

## Things we have done:
- Found data
- Got the data
- Brought different data sets together?
- Understood how the data is structured
- Figured out how to get total passengers entering/exiting a station per week (i.e. per data set)
- Figured out that there are outliers
- Figured out how to remove them
- Built the repo (get out code and data on GitHub)
- Assign different rolls to the project
  - Al: make the charts pretty
  - Da: start thinking about design of presentation
  - Darien: outline the content of the presentation
- Exactly what stats  we want to present and in what format

## To do:
- How much more data do we need?
- Apply our code to larger data sets
- What other visuals (if any) do we want to use to aid our presentation?
- What further analysis do we want to do?
  - time?
  - compare weekday to weekend?
